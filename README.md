# Project : Real-Time Air Quality Prediction System


## Introduction
This project is developed to monitor air quality in real time and provide accurate predictions using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.  
It helps in analyzing environmental data such as pollutant levels, particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), CO₂, NO₂, and other air quality indicators.  
The system supports better decision-making and preventive actions for pollution control.  



## Features
- Real-time monitoring of air quality data  
- Preprocessing and analysis of environmental parameters  
- Machine Learning-based prediction of future air quality levels  
- User-friendly structure for handling and visualizing data  
- Scalable design for integration with live sensors and large datasets  



## Project Structure
- **Code**: Main Python implementation including preprocessing, ML model, and prediction pipeline  
- **Datasets (optional)**: Can be included for training, testing, and validation  
- **Documentation**: Explains project purpose, workflow, and usage instructions  



## Future Scope
- Integration with IoT-based live air quality sensors  
- Development of interactive dashboards and advanced data visualizations  
- Use of deep learning models for more accurate predictions  
- Expansion to city-wide air quality monitoring networks  



## Conclusion
This project provides a foundation for real-time air quality prediction.  
With further integration of live data sources, advanced visualization, and AI/ML models, it can become a powerful tool for environmental monitoring, pollution control, and sustainable development.
